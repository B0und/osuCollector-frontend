                        The idea of osu!collector is to allow osu! players to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on beatmap collections.
                        <br/>
                        Currently there is little support for collection sharing/editing (they are encoded into one collections.db file).

                        osu!collector is run by <a href="https://twitter.com/mahloola" style={{textDecoration: "none"}}>myself</a> (mahloola) working on the front end and <a href="https://twitter.com/FunOrange42" style={{textDecoration: "none"}}>FunOrange</a> working on the back end.
